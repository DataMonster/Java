/* In the classic problem of the Towers of Hanoi, you have 3 rods and N disks of different sizes which can slide on to any 
tower The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (e g , each disk sits on top of an 
even larger one) You have the following constraints:
(A) Only one disk can be moved at a time
(B) A disk is slid off the top of one rod onto the next rod
(C) A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk
Write a program to move the disks from the first rod to the last using Stacks
