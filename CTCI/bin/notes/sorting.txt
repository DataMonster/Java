1. Merge sort:

1.1. Cascade merge sort:
Cascade merge sort is similar to the polyphase merge sort but uses a simpler distribution.
The merge is slower than a polyphase merge when there are fewer than six files, but 
faster when there are more than six.[1]

1.2. Oscillating merge sort:



1.3. Polyphase merge sort:
A polyphase merge sort is an algorithm which decreases the number of runs at every 
iteration of the main loop by merging runs into larger runs. It is used for external
 sorting.
 
1.4. Strand sort:
